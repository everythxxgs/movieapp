## Key Features

1. **Home Screen**
   - Displays random recommended movies
   - Floating action button to navigate to search

2. **Search Screen**
   - Search bar to find movies by title

   - Ratings and additional details

4. **Navigation**
   - Bottom navigation bar between home and search
   - Smooth transitions between screens

## Technical Implementation

- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose for modern, declarative UI
- **Networking**: Retrofit + OkHttp for API communication
- **Image Loading**: Coil for efficient image handling
- **State Management**: Kotlin Flow for reactive state updates

## Getting Started
